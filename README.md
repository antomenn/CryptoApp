# CryptoBox

CryptoBox is a simple app that allows users to stay up to date on the best cryptocurrencies on the market, watch the price trend through a very simple chart and don't miss a single variation!

The app does not use any external library and is mainly composed of 4 files:

-ContentView where there is the main structure of our app.

-CryptoData is where the data from the CoinGecko API are fetched.

-CryptoListView is where the view of our list is built graphically and where it is then possible to navigate into another View with the details.

-DetailsView is a modal as in this way the user navigation is simplified and here fundamental data are shown for each cryptocurrency and also the price trend of the last 7 days is shown through a simple LineChart.

Hope you like it!
